              Section 7 Note on data transfers to the US). The purpose of

              (e.g. in our contact form) is made by a human or by an automated
              program. For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behaviour of the

              starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the
              website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information
              (e.g. IP address, length of stay on the website or mouse movements
              made of the user). The data collected during the analysis is
              forwarded to Google. The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely

              NY 10011, USA. When you visit a page that offers one or more Vimeo
              video clips, a direct connection is established between your
              browser and a Vimeo server in the USA (see Section 7 Note on data
              transfers to the US). Information about your visit and your IP
              address is stored there. By interacting with the Vimeo plugins
              (e.g. clicking the play button), this information is transmitted
              to Vimeo and stored by Vimeo as well. If you have a Vimeo account
              and do not want Vimeo to collect information about you through our
              website and link information to your Vimeo account, you may log
              out of Vimeo before visiting our website. In addition, Vimeo uses

              takes place without distinction, limitation or exception, on the
              basis of the objective pursued and without objective criteria that
              would allow it to limit access by US authorities to personal data
              and its subsequent use to specific, strictly limited purposes that

              them to gain access to the data concerning them and to obtain
              their correction or deletion, and there is no effective legal
              protection against general access rights of US authorities. We
              explicitly draw attention to this legal and factual situation to
              the data subject so that he or she may make an informed decision
